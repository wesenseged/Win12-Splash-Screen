 This splash screen is inspired by a design concept showcased in a YouTube video envisioning the aesthetics of Windows 12. I've adapted and implemented this design to KDE Plasma 6, providing a sleek and modern splash screen experience. The concept captures the essence of futuristic design elements, blending seamlessly with the KDE Plasma environment. Enjoy the sleek and immersive splash screen as you boot up your system.
